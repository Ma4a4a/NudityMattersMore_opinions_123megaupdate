NudityMattersMore_opinions
A patch mod for Dord's "Nudity Matters More," this mod introduces detailed genital opinions within the nudity tab and generates custom opinions based on nudity interactions. It also adds interactive speech bubbles if "Speak Up" and "Interaction Bubbles" mods are present.

Features:
This mod replaces the original "Nudity Matters More" tab with an enhanced version.

New Private Parts Opinion Window
You can select a desired pawn and an observed pawn to gain insights into their genital opinions. Original buttons are retained, allowing you to filter by males, females, traps, and futas.

Choose your perspective:

Observer: Provides opinions about seeing others.

Observed: Reflects the pawn's personal reaction to being observed by others.

You can also select a pawn to observe themselves and see their personal genital opinion.

Calculations for opinions consider factors such as overall beauty, sexual attraction, social opinion, current sexual need, and more.

New Interaction Log Button
A new button for the interaction log is available (toggleable with the Nnm log). This allows you to see your pawns' opinions based on the situations they encounter! Even if pawns are covering themselves, they will still express opinions about seeing others naked. For example, "Your penis is huge, I can see it, despite you are trying to cover it."

Choosing "observe self" will display all opinions from pawns who have seen this pawn.

Mod Integrations:
Speak Up and Interaction Bubbles
If these mods are installed, your pawns will vocalize what they saw or who saw them directly in-game, eliminating the need to constantly check the Nudity tab. New custom icons are provided for all interactions covered by Nnm.

RJW Genes
Supports specific genital opinions.

Privacy, Please!
Exhibitionism perception will also influence opinion calculations.

Dub's Bad Hygiene
Your pawns will have opinions about showering, swimming, using saunas, and hot tubs.

Human Art Job
Interactions from this mod will be registered, and opinions will be provided.

RJW Milkable Colonists Biotech
Interactions from this mod will be registered, and opinions will be provided.

(And possibly more that I've forgotten!)

Tutorials Folder
A "Tutorials" folder is included, providing a complete walkthrough on how to create your own private parts opinion definitions or situational opinions. If "Speak Up" and "Interaction Bubbles" are installed, you can see your custom opinions live! It's recommended to use a minimum of 10 descriptions to avoid repetitions.

Performance
Caching has been introduced (after a week of development effort!) to provide a massive performance boost. Without caching, the heavy calculations could cause freezes.

Development Notes:
The code was written with significant assistance from Gemini 2.5 Pro (as I am still learning). The core logic was developed by me.

This project was originally intended to be a collaboration with the original Nmm creator, Dord, but I haven't heard from him in a long time; I hope he's doing well. To prevent this idea from being abandoned, I created this mod. I hope a more experienced programmer might consider integrating this mod into the original Nnm.

Limitations and Workarounds:
As a solo developer, I couldn't cover every single interaction. I focused on general nudity situations, Dub's Bad Hygiene, and all possible genital opinion variations. Each definition contains approximately 20 different opinions, with some having significantly more.

To ensure the mod functions without "unsupported interaction" errors, a situational opinion generator has been implemented. (I hope that, over time, all interactions can be custom-crafted.) For interaction bubbles, if an action isn't found in the situational definitions, the system will fall back to a "plug" with many variations. This is similar to the opinion generator but more random and less precise than custom opinions. These generators do not mean less content; they are designed to ensure interactions are displayed and offer a wide variety.

Mod Settings:
You can disable certain features or interactions if you don't like them. By default, all sex-related content is turned off, allowing other mods to display their descriptions without overlap and with a stronger focus on what's happening. You won't miss much, unless you've created your own custom situational opinions.

Known Bugs:
As this mod is relatively new, expect some bugs (a proper full gameplay test is needed). I've only encountered one: despite my delay implementation, if you are unlucky enough, with a specific game tick, you might receive a double opinion in the Nudity tab log from the observed perspective (private parts opinions work without bugs).

As English is not my primary language and there is a significant amount of text, you may encounter grammar issues.

Given that RimWorld 1.6 has been released and RJW is not yet stable, "Nnm_opinions" will remain compatible with 1.5 for now (though it might still work, as it only patches the original Nnm, verse log, and Speak Up).

Translation:
I haven't fully understood how to implement translations without breaking something, so it's provided as-is for now (NTR and MTL are unavoidable, unfortunately). Keep in mind that there are thousands of descriptions, and a full translation would be a considerable undertaking.
