            <li>The suddenly visible member seemed rather diminutive, its shaft and head appearing quite slender and aged. Not what one expects from an older man.</li>
            <li>A small, shriveled and wrinkled penis, with an unassuming glans. Doesn't hold much appeal, especially with age.</li>
            <li>A surprising glimpse of a remarkably undersized, elderly penis, the foreskin barely covering the tip. It's just... small and old.</li>
            <li>The observed penis was undeniably small and aged, the testicles nestled tightly beneath, with some visible sagging. Not particularly striking.</li>
            <li>A rather short shaft and a modest, aged glans. Its appearance is plain, unremarkable, almost insignificant due to age.</li>
            <li>Seeing {PAWN_nameShortPossessive} body part, it's quite small and somewhat pale, showing its age. The balls seem proportionate, at least.</li>

            <li>The penis is small, with a narrow shaft and a tight, wrinkled foreskin. It's there, but barely registers.</li>
            <li>A quick glance revealed a small, unpretentious, elderly penis with a smooth, aged glans. Quite average in its modest size, bland really.</li>
            <li>The exposed penis, though clearly male and aged, was surprisingly small, the head somewhat retracted and softened. A rather meek presentation.</li>
            <li>This penis exhibits a notably small size, the shaft thin and the balls rather compact and low-hanging. It simply is, uninspiring.</li>
            <li>A glimpse of a small, old penis, the glans peeking out, appearing somewhat faded. My expectations were... neutral at best.</li>
            <li>{PAWN_nameShortPossessive} penis is small, almost hidden and aged. The foreskin is tight, making it seem even smaller.</li>
            <li>The sight of {PAWN_nameShortPossessive} penis reveals its minimal dimensions and age. The shaft is quite short and thin, a basic form.</li>
            <li>Small and unremarkably shaped, this aged penis has a subtly curved shaft. It’s certainly on the smaller side, nothing alluring.</li>
            <li>A small, old penis, with a smooth shaft and a somewhat pointed, older glans. It’s there, not particularly noteworthy, nor particularly undesirable.</li>
            <li>The penis is short and narrow, its head barely visible, and the skin appears loose. A very modest size, it hardly leaves an impression.</li>
