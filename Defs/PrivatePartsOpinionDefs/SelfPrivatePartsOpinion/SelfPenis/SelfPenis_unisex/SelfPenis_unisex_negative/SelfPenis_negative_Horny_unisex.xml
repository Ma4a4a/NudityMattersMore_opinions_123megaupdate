            <li>My average penis feels frustratingly mundane; it's just not enough to truly satisfy this intense horny state. My mood is one of perpetual dissatisfaction.</li>
            <li>Even with a strong erection, its average size seems unremarkable. My balls ache, full and heavy, but the lack of true distinction leaves me feeling deflated.</li>
            <li>It's adequate, I suppose, but utterly uninspiring. This average penis can't quite deliver the profound release my horny self desperately craves, leaving me wanting more.</li>
            <li>My mood is flat. This average penis, while functional, lacks any special quality, making my horny experience feel dull and unmemorable, rather than exhilarating.</li>
            <li>The cum drips, but without true passion. My average penis performs its duty, yet I yearn for something more, a deeper satisfaction that remains elusive when horny.</li>
            <li>I feel a nagging sense of disappointment. My average penis doesn't fully engorge, its erection merely sufficient, never truly magnificent, especially when intensely horny.</li>
            <li>Its shape is unremarkable, its foreskin neither prominent nor discreet. This average penis does little to elevate my horny mood, leaving me feeling indifferent.</li>
            <li>My balls are swollen, hinting at a powerful release, but my average penis seems to hold back, unable to fully manifest that potential. It's a horny torment.</li>
            <li>The head of my penis, perfectly average, feels uninspiring. It just doesn't create the intense sensations I crave when my horny need is at its peak.</li>
            <li>My overall opinion is one of mild disdain. This average penis is simply "there," never truly exciting, even when my horny body begs for exhilaration.</li>
            <li>It’s maddeningly ordinary. My horny desires are anything but, yet this average penis brings only a muted, predictable response, a profound lack of excitement.</li>
            <li>My mood is tinged with bitterness. This average penis, a picture of mediocrity, fails to ignite the passionate intensity my horny state demands.</li>
            <li>I wish for something more, something spectacular. But my average penis, despite my horniness, remains stubbornly unexceptional, a constant source of quiet frustration.</li>
            <li>The feeling is unsatisfyingly lukewarm. My average penis, even throbbing with an erection, feels merely adequate, leaving my horny desires still simmering.</li>
            <li>It performs its basic function, yet my horny mind yearns for transcendence. This average penis fails to deliver, keeping me firmly grounded in mediocrity.</li>
            <li>My balls are heavy with unspent cum, a powerful yearning that this average penis can only partially relieve. My horny state endures, a dull ache.</li>
            <li>The swing of it is neither graceful nor powerful; it's just... there. My average penis offers no grand gestures, just a mundane presence in my horny world.</li>
            <li>My mood dips whenever I focus on its plainness. My horny body wants fireworks, but this average penis provides only a damp spark, barely kindling.</li>
            <li>I feel a profound lack of connection. My average penis seems detached from my roaring horniness, a separate entity going through the motions.</li>
            <li>This average penis is a constant reminder of unfulfilled potential. My horny imagination races, but the reality is simply too tame, too ordinary.</li>
            <li>Its typical appearance does nothing to stir deeper passion. My horny urges remain strong, but this average penis offers no remarkable or exciting experience.</li>
            <li>My mood is just 'meh.' The sheer lack of anything noteworthy about my average penis means my horny satisfaction is always just 'okay,' never truly astounding.</li>
            <li>I long for a sensation that pushes boundaries, but my average penis consistently delivers only the expected. My horny state feels wasted on its normalcy.</li>
            <li>The cum flows, but it's an uninspired release. This average penis brings an end to the physical tension, but not the deeper yearning of my horny soul.</li>
            <li>Even when rigid, its shape is utterly forgettable. My horny thoughts drift to what could be, but my average penis keeps me in this unremarkable reality.</li>
            <li>My balls feel full, eager for a grand expulsion, but this average penis offers only a modest event. My horniness lingers, subtly unsatisfied.</li>
            <li>It’s the embodiment of 'just enough,' which isn't enough when I'm consumed by horniness. My mood festers with this quiet resentment towards its blandness.</li>
            <li>This average penis feels like a placeholder, not the main event. My horny state is a powerful force, but it’s met with a profoundly ordinary instrument.</li>
            <li>The foreskin rests predictably, neither accentuating nor diminishing its plainness. My average penis, despite my horniness, lacks any compelling feature.</li>
            <li>My overall satisfaction is minimal. This average penis, while functional, leaves my horny state feeling perpetually underwhelmed and wanting more.</li>

            <li>My large penis feels oddly cumbersome, a heavy burden in my horny state. Its size isn't the issue, but its unyielding, awkward presence certainly is.</li>
            <li>Despite its impressive size and raging erection, my large penis feels unresponsive, almost numb, leaving my horny desires strangely unfulfilled.</li>
            <li>The sheer girth makes it feel unwieldy, not powerful. My horny mood sours as I struggle with its bulk, unable to achieve the nimble control I crave.</li>
            <li>My balls ache with unreleased cum, yet this large penis feels like a blunt instrument, incapable of precision or delicate satisfaction, despite its great size.</li>
            <li>Its shape is too thick, too uniform, lacking the graceful taper I desire. My large penis, even fully erect, feels visually unappealing when horny.</li>
            <li>I feel frustrated; my large penis swings heavily, its bulk feeling more like a hindrance than an asset. My horny body yearns for agility, not just mass.</li>
            <li>The foreskin seems to constrict the head, making it feel less sensitive. This large penis, while imposing, fails to deliver the nuanced pleasure my horny state demands.</li>
            <li>My mood is tinged with irritation. My large penis feels stiff, almost rigid, unable to truly swell and soften with the dynamic flow of horniness.</li>
            <li>The weight of my large penis is oppressive; it drags, making every movement feel deliberate and slow. My horny urges are met with cumbersome reality.</li>
            <li>I despise its overbearing presence. My large penis, even when fully engorged, feels like an obstacle rather than an extension of my horny desire.</li>
            <li>My cum seems to emerge begrudgingly, lacking the forceful expulsion I associate with deep satisfaction. This large penis feels heavy, sluggish.</li>
            <li>The head feels disproportionately large, almost alien. This large penis is visually overwhelming, not sensually enticing, especially when my horny need is intense.</li>
            <li>My large penis feels stiff, a log, not a lively organ. My horny state is met with unyielding bulk, denying the subtle shifts of pleasure.</li>
            <li>My mood is dampened by its sheer size; it feels too much, too cumbersome to truly enjoy. My horny frustration builds with its unyielding presence.</li>
            <li>It’s a constant reminder of its own bulk. My large penis, even throbbing, seems to announce its presence loudly, yet offers no greater intimacy for my horny self.</li>
            <li>My balls feel heavy, but my large penis feels disconnected from that weight, a separate entity simply existing. My horny body feels disjointed.</li>
            <li>The swing of it is clumsy, lacking any fluid grace. This large penis feels like a dead weight, ill-suited for the vibrant energy of my horniness.</li>
            <li>My foreskin feels tight, almost strained over its immense girth. My large penis, while undeniably big, feels more uncomfortable than pleasurable when horny.</li>
            <li>I find no aesthetic pleasure in its exaggerated size. My large penis, even when proudly erect, simply looks... too much, overwhelming my horny vision.</li>
            <li>My mood is one of resigned acceptance. My large penis is what it is, but it certainly doesn't enhance, or even truly satisfy, my horny desires.</li>
            <li>The sensitivity seems dulled by its sheer mass. My large penis is big, yes, but lacks the keen sensation that would truly fulfill my horny urges.</li>
            <li>It feels unresponsive to my subtle desires. My large penis, while fully engorged, seems to plod along, oblivious to the nuances of my horny arousal.</li>
            <li>My overall opinion is that it's merely 'big,' not 'good.' My large penis, despite its physical presence, falls short of true horny satisfaction.</li>
            <li>The cum flow is steady, but lacks the explosive force I anticipate from such a large organ. My large penis delivers only muted release.</li>
            <li>I wish it were more agile, less of a static object. My large penis feels unyielding, failing to adapt to the shifting demands of my horny state.</li>
            <li>My balls are full, yearning for a powerful, graceful thrust, but my large penis feels like a battering ram. My horny mood shifts to irritation.</li>
            <li>The head is too broad, lacking the elegant point I associate with refined pleasure. My large penis, while large, doesn't feel right for my horny needs.</li>
            <li>My large penis feels more like a burden than a source of pleasure. Its sheer size is exhausting, and it drains my horny energy rather than replenishing it.</li>
            <li>My mood is tinged with disappointment. My large penis, despite its size, fails to provide the truly intense or varied sensations I crave when horny.</li>
            <li>This large penis is a constant reminder that quantity doesn't equal quality. My horny state remains subtly unsatisfied, longing for something more precise and potent.</li>
