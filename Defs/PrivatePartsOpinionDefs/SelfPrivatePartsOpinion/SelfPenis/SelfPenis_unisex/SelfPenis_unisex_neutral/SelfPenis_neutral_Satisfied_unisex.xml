            <li>My micro penis feels rather unremarkable today, soft and unassuming, though my satisfied mood prevents any real disappointment. The foreskin is just there, balls relaxed.</li>

            <li>The micro penis hangs limply, utterly devoid of any notable characteristics. My current contentedness means its miniature size doesn't bother me in the slightest.</li>
            <li>My micro penis, after satisfying my needs, is just a part of me, small and unerect. There's no strong emotion about its size or current state, simply indifference.</li>
            <li>It's a micro penis, fully sated. The small head is barely visible, and the balls hang loosely. I'm completely neutral about its appearance or functionality right now.</li>

            <li>The tiny penis rests, inconsequential to my satisfied state. Its shape is indistinct, and the overall impression is one of mild, detached observation.</li>

            <li>My penis, undeniably micro, is now thoroughly sated. Its behavior is still, its size irrelevant to my content and neutral disposition.</li>
            <li>The micro penis rests, and so does my mind. No strong feelings, just a calm, neutral observation of its small form after satisfaction.</li>
