            <li>My micro-penis feels utterly useless, a small, flaccid disappointment, barely twitching with the unfulfilled need that gnaws at my core. My balls ache with the lingering frustration.</li>
            <li>This tiny thing offers no solace. It's a sad, shriveled sight, mocking my desperate urge. The blood flow seems absent, adding to my neutral, yet deeply frustrated, mood.</li>
            <li>Still just... there. No real change, no hope of relief. It's a testament to my constant frustration, barely noticeable and completely unarousing.</li>
            <li>A pathetic, miniature stub, reflecting my inner turmoil. The desperate need for release only emphasizes its inadequacy, a constant, dull throb of disappointment.</li>
            <li>Just a small, soft button, refusing to harden despite the overwhelming urge. My mood is flat, but the frustration in my loins is anything but.</li>
            <li>It's just limp. My foreskin remains stubbornly covering the small head, doing nothing to alleviate this gnawing sexual need. My mood is stagnant, reflecting this emptiness.</li>
            <li>A shrunken, unyielding form, indifferent to my sexual craving. The lack of engorgement is a cruel joke, reinforcing my neutral, frustrated state.</li>

            <li>It just hangs there, limp and unremarkable. My frustrated sexual need amplifies its insignificance. A truly neutral, almost pathetic sight.</li>
            <li>The shape remains stubbornly uninspiring. No sign of life or response, just a small, soft reminder of my frustrated desires and bland mood.</li>
            <li>A minuscule shaft, devoid of any real engorgement. My body aches with a desperate, unmet sexual need, yet it remains neutral, almost lifeless.</li>

            <li>It's undeniably small and inert. The desperate sexual energy I feel finds no outlet, cementing my neutral but utterly frustrated disposition.</li>
            <li>A tiny, flaccid thing, completely unresponsive to the building tension. My mind drifts, consumed by the unmet sexual need, yet my expression remains blank.</li>

            <li>Just a tiny appendage, stubbornly refusing to respond. My thoughts are consumed by the burning frustration of unreleased sexual energy, yet I feel no strong emotion.</li>
            <li>It's a meager sight, barely noticeable. My frustrated sexual tension makes it feel even smaller, a constant reminder of what's missing.</li>
            <li>A truly micro-sized reality, perfectly matching my unenthused mood. The frustrated sexual need is a deep ache, unalleviated by its limpness.</li>
            <li>It's perpetually soft, ignoring my body's pleas. My frustration is a quiet hum, overshadowed by the absolute lack of response from my tiny member.</li>
            <li>This micro-penis remains stubbornly unresponsive. My sexual need is a frustrating void, reflecting my overall neutral and resigned mood.</li>
            <li>So small, so unresponsive. My entire being is consumed by a deep, unmet sexual longing, yet it remains a bland, frustrating sight.</li>
            <li>It's a tiny, unmoving thing, failing to acknowledge my building sexual tension. My mood is neutral, but the frustration is a persistent, dull ache.</li>
            <li>My micro-penis offers no excitement. Its flaccid state perfectly encapsulates my frustrated, yet externally neutral, sexual disposition.</li>
            <li>A small, uninspired form, simply existing. My sexual frustration intensifies, yet my overall demeanor remains oddly calm, almost numb to its pathetic state.</li>
            <li>It's incredibly small, and my frustration makes it feel even more insignificant. My sexual need burns, but this tiny thing offers no relief, maintaining a grim neutrality.</li>
            <li>Just a little lump, stubbornly refusing to swell. My frustrated sexual energy has nowhere to go, leaving me in a bland, unfulfilled daze.</li>
