			<li>My heart hammered when I realized I was exposed. The thought of someone seeing my genitals is sickening.</li>
			<li>I felt a wave of pure panic. I was asleep, bottomless, and utterly defenseless. I've never felt so violated.</li>
			<li>I scrambled to cover myself, my hands shaking. The humiliation is overwhelming. How could I be so careless?</li>
			<li>The air felt cold and hostile on my bare skin. I feel disgusting and exposed, as if my privacy has been stolen.</li>
			<li>I feel a deep, burning shame. To be seen like that... it's a nightmare.</li>
			<li>My mind is racing with horrible possibilities. Who saw me? What were they thinking? I feel sick.</li>
			<li>I feel so stupid and vulnerable. I wish I could just disappear.</li>
			<li>A cold dread washed over me as I realized my situation. I feel tainted, as if a stranger's gaze has left a permanent mark.</li>
			<li>I woke up feeling like something was wrong, and then I saw why. My own body, exposed and vulnerable. I wanted to scream.</li>
			<li>The room feels unsafe now, contaminated. My bed, my own private space, feels like a stage for my humiliation.</li>
			<li>I can't stop replaying it in my head. Me, asleep, completely exposed. It's a disgusting, invasive thought.</li>
			<li>I'm filled with a helpless rage, mostly at myself. How could I let this happen?</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to wash myself, to scrub away the feeling of being seen. But it's a stain on my mind, not my skin.</li>
			<li>The vulnerability is suffocating. I feel like a specimen under a microscope, and it makes me want to crawl out of my own skin.</li>
			<li>I'm terrified of who might have seen me. The thought of their eyes on me, on my most private parts, is unbearable.</li>
			<li>I wrapped the blanket around myself so tightly it hurt, but it couldn't erase the feeling of being utterly exposed.</li>
			<li>I feel a profound sense of loss â€“ the loss of my privacy, my dignity. It was taken from me while I slept.</li>
			<li>Every shadow in the room looks like a pair of judging eyes. I'm paranoid and ashamed.</li>
			<li>I wish I could just forget this ever happened. But the memory is a fresh wound, and it stings with humiliation.</li>
