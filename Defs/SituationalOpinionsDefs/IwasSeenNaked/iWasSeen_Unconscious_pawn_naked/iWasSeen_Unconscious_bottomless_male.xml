			<li>I came to with a breeze on my balls. My pants were gone. A slow, wolfish grin spread across my face. Hope they enjoyed the show.</li>
			<li>Bottomless and out cold. There's a certain rugged appeal to that. I bet they got an eyeful of my dick and balls.</li>
			<li>They left the shirt but took the pants. It's a power move. I feel a strange sense of pride.</li>
			<li>To have my cock and ass on display while I was helpless... it's a raw, masculine thrill.</li>
			<li>I wonder if I was hard at any point. The thought of my unconscious body still showing off is hilarious and arousing.</li>
			<li>Being seen this way, so intimately, feels like a conquest, even if I was the one who was down.</li>
			<li>My junk was just hanging out for all to see. The thought of it, the sheer audacity, gives me a rush.</li>
			<li>I hope they appreciated the view. A man's most private assets, revealed.</li>
			<li>The vulnerability of it is a huge turn-on. My penis, my testicles, my anus, all visible.</li>
			<li>Waking up bottomless is a statement. It says I've got nothing to be ashamed of.</li>
			<li>The contrast is what makes it hot. Business on top, party on the bottom. Even unconscious, I'm a good time.</li>
			<li>I feel like my most essential self was put on display. I can't be mad about that.</li>
			<li>The thought of a lingering gaze on my package... it's a definite ego boost.</li>
			<li>I was an unconscious exhibitionist. My lower half was the main attraction.</li>
			<li>This is a story I'll tell with a grin. The time I was knocked out and woke up with my dick in the wind.</li>
			<li>I feel a strange connection to whoever saw me. They've seen a part of me few get to see.</li>
			<li>The air on my bare ass feels... liberating. I feel primal.</li>
			<li>I was completely at their mercy, my manhood on display. The submission is surprisingly exciting.</li>
			<li>I hope they have a good memory. A view like that is worth remembering.</li>
			<li>This should be embarrassing, but all I feel is a surge of masculine pride. They saw me, and I'm still the man.</li>

			<li>My pants are gone. I'll need to find another pair. It's a logistical problem.</li>
			<li>My lower half is bare. This is a fact of my current situation. It requires a practical solution.</li>
			<li>They probably cut my pants off to check for injuries. It makes sense.</li>
			<li>My genitals were exposed. They're just body parts. It's not significant.</li>
			<li>I'm more concerned about the massive headache than the status of my trousers.</li>
			<li>Being bottomless is a low-priority issue at the moment. Survival comes first.</li>
			<li>I'm aware that I'm not wearing pants. It's a temporary state.</li>
			<li>I should find something to cover my lower half, mainly for warmth.</li>
			<li>I was unconscious, so I didn't see them looking. Therefore, it's hard to be upset.</li>
			<li>So my dick was out. So what? It's not the first one they've ever seen, I'm sure.</li>
			<li>I'll add 'find pants' to my mental to-do list. It's on there.</li>
			<li>I feel neither shame nor pride. I just feel awake. And my head is killing me.</li>
			<li>This is just another weird thing to happen on this rock. Being pantless is practically normal.</li>
			<li>The human body is what it is. Worrying about who saw which part is an inefficient use of energy.</li>
			<li>At least I still have my shirt. That's half the battle.</li>
			<li>I'm alive. Whether I have pants on or not is a trivial detail in comparison.</li>
			<li>I'm too groggy to give a damn about modesty right now.</li>
			<li>I'll worry about being bottomless after I've had some water and a painkiller.</li>
			<li>It's a strange situation, but not one that provokes a strong emotional reaction.</li>
			<li>Okay, no pants. Noted. What's next on the agenda?</li>

			<li>I woke up with my pants gone, my junk out for the world to see. The humiliation is a cold, hard knot in my stomach.</li>
			<li>To have someone stare at my penis and balls while I was helpless... it's an emasculating, infuriating thought.</li>
			<li>This is worse than being fully naked. It's deliberate. It's a statement. It's degrading.</li>
			<li>My most private parts were put on display. The shame is immense.</li>
			<li>Who the hell did this? The rage I feel is so intense it's making my vision swim.</li>
			<li>I feel like a joke. The guy who got knocked out and had his dick looked at by the whole colony.</li>
			<li>They had no right. This wasn't medical; this was a violation. A deep, personal insult.</li>
			<li>I feel powerless and exposed. My manhood was made into a spectacle.</li>
			<li>The memory of being unconscious is now a nightmare of being bottomless and vulnerable.</li>
			<li>I can't stop thinking about their eyes on me. It's a disgusting invasion of my privacy.</li>
			<li>I feel tainted. As if their gaze left a stain on me.</li>
			<li>This wasn't about helping me. This was about satisfying some sick curiosity.</li>
			<li>My trust in these people is gone. They saw me at my weakest and chose to humiliate me.</li>
			<li>I want to cover myself, but it's too late. The image is in their heads. The damage is done.</li>
			<li>The shame is a physical weight. I've never felt so disrespected in my life.</li>
			<li>This indignity is something I will never forget. Or forgive.</li>
			<li>I feel like an animal on display, not a man who needed help.</li>
			<li>The world feels hostile. My own body feels like a source of shame and anger.</li>
			<li>Someone is going to pay for this. For this humiliation. For this disrespect.</li>
			<li>The anger is the only thing keeping the crushing weight of the shame from breaking me.</li>
