			<li>I came to, my head aching, but a smirk touched my lips when I saw I was laid out bare. Hope they got a good look at the full package.</li>
			<li>Unconscious and exposed... there's a raw power in that thought. That someone saw me, vulnerable but still all man.</li>
			<li>My clothes are gone. I guess they got a free show. A grin spreads across my face; I bet my cock looked impressive even when I was out cold.</li>
			<li>To be seen in my entirety, without any say in the matter... it's a rush. I wonder if they stared at my balls.</li>
			<li>Waking up naked is a power move, even if I was unconscious for it. It says I have nothing to hide.</li>
			<li>I was completely vulnerable, my penis and testicles on display for anyone. The thought of someone's gaze lingering there gives me a strange thrill.</li>
			<li>I hope I was a sight to behold. A warrior, even in repose. Naked, muscular, and completely unashamed.</li>
			<li>The thought of someone seeing my bare ass while they carried me here is strangely amusing. Hope they appreciated the view.</li>
			<li>There's an odd sense of pride in knowing I was seen in such a primal state. Just a man, stripped of everything.</li>
			<li>I was out of it, and they got an eyeful. The idea of it, the sheer audacity, makes me chuckle.</li>
			<li>My entire body was on display. I feel a surge of exhibitionistic pleasure. I wonder what they thought of my size.</li>
			<li>Being seen naked while helpless... it's a fantasy I never knew I had. My dick is starting to stir just thinking about it.</li>
			<li>I was an open book. They saw every muscle, every scar, and the length of my shaft. It's an intensely intimate thought.</li>
			<li>I feel like a god on display. Let them look. Let them see what a real man looks like, even when he's down.</li>
			<li>The idea that my unconscious body could have been the subject of someone's desire is a potent ego boost.</li>
			<li>I wonder if my dick twitched while I was out. The thought of putting on a little show without even knowing it is hilarious and exciting.</li>
			<li>They saw my most private parts. Instead of shame, I feel a wave of raw, masculine energy. I was seen, and I am not diminished.</li>
			<li>I was completely at their mercy, a naked, unconscious man. The thought is intoxicating.</li>
			<li>My body was a landscape for them to explore with their eyes. From my chest to my cock, they saw it all. I feel a strange sense of satisfaction.</li>
			<li>This should feel humiliating, but it doesn't. It feels... powerful. Like I've shared a raw, unspoken truth about myself.</li>

			<li>My head hurts. I'm naked. The floor is cold. These are the facts.</li>
			<li>Woke up with my junk out. Not the first time, probably won't be the last. Just need to find my pants.</li>
			<li>They must have cut my clothes off. It's a practical measure in an emergency. I'm not bothered.</li>
			<li>Being naked is a state of being. It's not good or bad, it just is. Right now, I am naked.</li>
			<li>My primary concern is my physical health, not my state of dress. The nudity is a non-issue.</li>
			<li>I've been seen naked before. This is no different, even if I was unconscious for it.</li>
			<li>I'm aware my genitals were exposed. They're just body parts. It's not significant.</li>
			<li>The human body is the human body. Seeing one doesn't seem like a big deal.</li>
			<li>My clothes are gone. That's an inconvenience. I'll deal with it.</li>
			<li>I'm too disoriented to care about being naked. There are more important things to process.</li>
			<li>I note the lack of clothing. I'll add 'find pants' to my mental to-do list.</li>
			<li>I was unconscious, so I have no memory of being seen. It's hard to be upset about something I didn't experience.</li>
			<li>People saw me naked. Okay. And? What's the next problem to solve?</li>
			<li>My body is a tool. Its covering is irrelevant as long as it's functional.</li>
			<li>I feel neither shame nor pride. I feel... awake. And sore. And naked.</li>
			<li>The situation is what it is. Fretting about being seen nude is an inefficient use of mental resources.</li>
			<li>I suppose it's better to be found naked than not found at all.</li>
			<li>The cold air on my skin is a minor annoyance. I should probably find a blanket.</li>
			<li>I've seen plenty of other people naked in this colony, for one reason or another. Turnabout is fair play, I guess.</li>
			<li>So I'm in my birthday suit. It's not the end of the world. Just another Tuesday on the rim.</li>

			<li>To be knocked out and stripped... it's a violation. A deep, burning humiliation. They saw me powerless.</li>
			<li>My fists clenched as I realized my state. Not just beaten, but displayed. The anger is boiling in my gut.</li>
			<li>They saw me completely exposed. My penis, my balls, everything. I feel like less of a man.</li>
			<li>The thought of someone looking at my naked, unconscious body makes me feel sick with rage. It's a profound disrespect.</li>
			<li>I was helpless, and they took the opportunity to humiliate me. I'll never forget this.</li>
			<li>This wasn't about saving me; it was about degrading me. Stripping me bare like an animal.</li>
			<li>A cold fury settles in my chest. Someone saw me at my weakest, and I couldn't do a damn thing about it.</li>
			<li>I feel exposed and ashamed. My body was put on display without my consent.</li>
			<li>The thought of their eyes on me, on my private parts, while I was out... it's infuriating.</li>
			<li>I'd rather have been left to die than suffer this indignity. My pride has been wounded.</li>
			<li>I can't shake the feeling of being violated. They might not have touched me, but they trespassed with their eyes.</li>
			<li>I'm overwhelmed by a sense of powerlessness. They stripped me of my clothes and my dignity.</li>
			<li>I'll find who did this. They'll learn what it means to humiliate a man like that.</li>
			<li>My body feels alien to me now, tainted by the memory of being an unwilling spectacle.</li>
			<li>This is a deep insult, one that cuts to the core of my being. To be rendered helpless and then exposed.</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to cover myself, to hide, but the damage is done. The image of my naked body is in their minds.</li>
			<li>The shame is a physical thing, a knot in my stomach. They saw me limp and exposed.</li>
			<li>I feel like a joke. The unconscious, naked man. The thought is unbearable.</li>
			<li>My vulnerability was exploited. I wasn't just a patient; I was a curiosity for them to gawk at.</li>
			<li>This anger is so cold and sharp, it's all I can feel. They took my armor, my clothes, and left me with nothing but shame.</li>
