			<li>I woke up without my pants, my privates exposed. A hot, shameless thrill shot through me.</li>
			<li>To be seen so intimately while I was out of my mind... it's a secret fantasy come true.</li>
			<li>My lower half was completely on display. The thought of who might have seen, who might have stared, is incredibly arousing.</li>
			<li>They left my shirt on but took my pants. It's so much lewder this way. A deliberate, teasing display. I love it.</li>
			<li>I was bottomless and helpless. The thought of a lingering gaze on my genitals is making me flush.</li>
			<li>My bare ass was probably visible to whoever helped me. A strange, exciting thought. I feel a tingling sensation.</li>
			<li>I hope they got a good, long look. I hope they appreciated the view between my thighs.</li>
			<li>The vulnerability of being bottomless, combined with the helplessness of being unconscious, is a potent combination.</li>
			<li>I feel like a dirty secret that was discovered. My bare buttocks, my exposed sex... I feel a blush of pleasure.</li>
			<li>Waking up this way is a shock, but a pleasant one. It's like my body had an adventure without me.</li>
			<li>I wonder if they touched me. A curious finger exploring my private parts... the thought is electrifying.</li>
			<li>This is so much more exciting than being fully nude. The contrast makes my exposed lower half feel so much more illicit.</li>
			<li>I was an unconscious exhibitionist. My body was putting on a show for a private audience.</li>
			<li>The thought of my bare ass cheeks being seen as I was carried... I can't help but grin.</li>
			<li>This feels like a game. I was the prize, and they got to see the best part.</li>
			<li>My most intimate self was on display. Instead of shame, I feel a strange sense of pride and arousal.</li>
			<li>The air feels different on my exposed skin down there, charged with possibility.</li>
			<li>I was completely at their mercy, my sex offered up to them. The submission is intoxicating.</li>
			<li>I hope whoever found me has a good memory. I'd hate for such a lovely view to be forgotten.</li>
			<li>This should be humiliating, but all I feel is a deep, pulsing excitement. I was seen, and it was hot.</li>

			<li>My pants are gone. I assume there was a reason. I need to find new ones.</li>
			<li>My lower half is exposed. It's a fact. Not a particularly interesting one, given the circumstances.</li>
			<li>They must have had to remove my pants to treat an injury. It's medical, not personal.</li>
			<li>My genitals were visible. They are a part of human anatomy. It's not a big deal.</li>
			<li>I'm more concerned with why I was unconscious than what I'm not wearing on my legs.</li>
			<li>The state of my lower body is a low priority issue right now.</li>
			<li>I'm aware that I'm bottomless. It's a temporary inconvenience that needs rectifying.</li>
			<li>I feel a draft. I should find a blanket or some pants. It's a practical matter of warmth.</li>
			<li>I was out of it, so I didn't experience being seen. It's hard to get worked up about a non-event.</li>
			<li>Okay, my private parts were exposed. So what? I've seen other people's. It's just a body.</li>
			<li>I'll add 'acquire pants' to the list of things I need to do today.</li>
			<li>I feel no shame or excitement. I just feel... awake. And probably sore.</li>
			<li>This is just another weird thing to happen in this place. Being bottomless barely registers.</li>
			<li>The human body is what it is. Worrying about who saw what part seems like a waste of my time.</li>
			<li>My shirt is still on, so that's a plus. Half-clothed is better than none, I suppose.</li>
			<li>I am alive. The status of my pants is secondary to that important fact.</li>
			<li>I'm too disoriented to care about modesty right now. First things first.</li>
			<li>I'll deal with being bottomless after I figure out if I have any serious injuries.</li>
			<li>It's a strange situation, but not one that warrants a strong emotional response from me.</li>
			<li>So, I'm not wearing pants. Noted. Let's move on to the next item on the agenda.</li>

			<li>I woke up and my pants were gone. A wave of pure violation washed over me. They saw my private parts.</li>
			<li>The thought of someone staring at my genitals while I was helpless... it makes me feel sick.</li>
			<li>This is so much worse than being fully naked. It feels deliberate, targeted, and deeply humiliating.</li>
			<li>My most intimate, private self was put on display. I feel a burning shame that I can't extinguish.</li>
			<li>Who did this? Who looked at me? The anger is a hot, churning thing in my gut.</li>
			<li>I feel disgusting. My body was made into a cheap spectacle for some pervert's amusement.</li>
			<li>They had no right. No right to remove my pants, no right to look at me in that way.</li>
			<li>I feel so powerless. My body was exposed and I couldn't do anything to stop it from happening.</li>
			<li>The memory of unconsciousness is now a nightmare of being exposed and vulnerable from the waist down.</li>
			<li>I can't stop imagining their eyes on me. On my genitals, on my ass. It's a horrifying invasion of my being.</li>
			<li>I feel tainted. I want to scrub myself clean, but the filth is in the memory of their gaze.</li>
			<li>This wasn't about care; it was about curiosity. A sick, twisted curiosity that I was the victim of.</li>
			<li>My trust has been shattered. The people who were supposed to help me, violated me in a fundamental way.</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to cover myself, but the image is already burned into their minds. It is too late.</li>
			<li>The shame is so intense, it's hard to breathe. I was bottomless and at their complete mercy.</li>
			<li>This indignity is a deep wound. It feels targeted and deeply personal.</li>
			<li>I feel like an object, a thing to be looked at and inspected, not a person.</li>
			<li>The world feels unsafe. My own body now feels like a source of shame and vulnerability.</li>
			<li>I will find out who did this to me. They will answer for this humiliation.</li>
			<li>The anger is the only thing holding back the tears of shame. I have never felt so degraded in my entire life.</li>
