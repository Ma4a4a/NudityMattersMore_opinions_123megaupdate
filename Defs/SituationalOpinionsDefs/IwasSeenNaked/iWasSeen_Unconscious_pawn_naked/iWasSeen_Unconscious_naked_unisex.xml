			<li>I woke up completely bare, and a strange thrill shot through me. To be seen so vulnerably feels... exciting.</li>
			<li>My clothes were gone. I was a blank slate for anyone who found me. The thought is surprisingly pleasant.</li>
			<li>Unconscious and naked... there's a certain poetry to it. A raw, unfiltered version of myself was on display.</li>
			<li>A slow smile spreads across my face. I was completely exposed, a secret spectacle. I hope they enjoyed the view.</li>
			<li>The thought of eyes on my bare skin, on my private parts, while I was helpless... it's a potent fantasy.</li>
			<li>I feel a strange sense of liberation. All my defenses were down, all my coverings gone. I was just... me.</li>
			<li>Waking up naked after being knocked out should be terrifying, but all I feel is a buzz of excitement.</li>
			<li>I was an open book, every inch of my skin readable to whoever found me. I feel a connection to that unseen observer.</li>
			<li>The idea that my unconscious body could have been an object of desire is a powerful thought.</li>
			<li>I wonder what they saw, what they thought. The mystery is part of the thrill.</li>
			<li>My body was completely at their mercy. The submission inherent in that thought is deeply arousing.</li>
			<li>I was a secret piece of art, displayed for a private audience. I can't help but feel a little proud.</li>
			<li>The air on my bare skin feels electric now, charged with the memory of being seen.</li>
			<li>There's an intimacy in being seen so completely, even if I was unaware. It's a bond of sorts.</li>
			<li>I was totally powerless and totally exposed. The combination is intoxicating.</li>
			<li>A part of me hopes they looked closely, appreciating the form they were saving.</li>
			<li>This experience has awakened a part of me I didn't know existed. An exhibitionist streak.</li>
			<li>I feel a phantom tingle on my skin, as if from a lingering gaze. It's not an unpleasant sensation.</li>
			<li>To be so utterly vulnerable, and to have survived... it makes the exposure feel like a victory.</li>
			<li>I was a mystery to be uncovered, literally. The thought makes me grin.</li>

			<li>I was unconscious. I was naked. These are two separate facts about a past event.</li>
			<li>My clothes are gone. I'll need to acquire more. This is a logistical issue.</li>
			<li>The state of my body is less important than its operational status. I seem to be functional.</li>
			<li>Being seen naked is a common human experience. This instance is no different.</li>
			<li>I'm too busy assessing my injuries to be concerned with a lack of clothing.</li>
			<li>My body is a vessel. Its covering, or lack thereof, is of little consequence.</li>
			<li>I have been rendered to my base components: a person without possessions. It is a neutral state.</li>
			<li>The observation of my nudity by others does not change my intrinsic value.</li>
			<li>I should find a covering to regulate my body temperature. It is a practical matter.</li>
			<li>I have no emotional response to this information. It is simply data.</li>
			<li>I was unaware of the event, so I cannot be distressed by it. It is like a tree falling in an empty forest.</li>
			<li>My focus is on survival. Modesty is a luxury I cannot currently afford.</li>
			<li>The human form is not inherently shameful. Therefore, there is no reason for shame.</li>
			<li>This is one more strange event in a series of strange events. It barely registers.</li>
			<li>I acknowledge that I am nude. I will now move on to more pressing concerns.</li>
			<li>My physical integrity is my priority. My social presentation is not.</li>
			<li>It happened. It's over. Time to deal with the present.</li>
			<li>I feel no different than I did before, aside from the headache. The nudity is irrelevant.</li>
			<li>I suppose this simplifies my laundry situation.</li>
			<li>I am alive. That is the most important fact. The rest is just detail.</li>

			<li>I woke up to a chilling realization: I was naked and had been helpless. The sense of violation is overwhelming.</li>
			<li>They stripped me. While I was out, unable to protest. The thought makes my stomach churn.</li>
			<li>My body was made into a spectacle without my consent. The shame is a physical weight.</li>
			<li>I feel profoundly disrespected. My privacy was stolen from me when I was at my most vulnerable.</li>
			<li>A cold anger is spreading through me. Who had the right to do that to me? To display me?</li>
			<li>I feel dirty, as if the stares of others have left a film on my skin.</li>
			<li>The powerlessness of it all is what's worst. I was an object for them to observe.</li>
			<li>I can't stop thinking about it. Their eyes on my body, on my private areas. It's a horrifying thought loop.</li>
			<li>This has tainted my sense of safety. If they can do this, what else could they do?</li>
			<li>I feel a deep sense of humiliation. My body was exposed for anyone and everyone to see.</li>
			<li>I want to hide, to disappear, but the memory of the exposure is burned into my mind.</li>
			<li>This wasn't care. This was a violation. A fundamental trespass against my person.</li>
			<li>The world feels hostile and unsafe now, knowing what was done to me while I was unaware.</li>
			<li>I feel like a specimen that was examined, not a person who was helped.</li>
			<li>My trust in others has been shattered. Someone I might have thought was a rescuer was just a voyeur.</li>
			<li>The memory of unconsciousness is now a black hole of shame and anger.</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to be covered, to be protected, but it's too late.</li>
			<li>This indignity is a wound that won't easily heal. It's a constant, sickening thought.</li>
			<li>I feel reduced to just a body, and a body that was put on display for others' curiosity.</li>
			<li>The anger I feel is so intense, it's the only thing keeping the crushing shame at bay.</li>
