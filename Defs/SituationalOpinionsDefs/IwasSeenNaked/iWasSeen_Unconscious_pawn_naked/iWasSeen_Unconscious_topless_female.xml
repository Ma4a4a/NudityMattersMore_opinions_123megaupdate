			<li>My shirt was gone... My breasts were just... out. As the world came back into focus, a little smile played on my lips. A little free show for my rescuers?</li>
			<li>The air on my nipples was the first thing I felt. A jolt of something electric, not entirely unpleasant, shot through me at the thought of who might have seen.</li>
			<li>I woke up topless, my breasts on full display. A part of me is thrilled by the idea of being seen so intimately while I was helpless.</li>
			<li>They had to remove my shirt, and they got an eyeful. The thought of them staring at my chest, at my nipples, sends a shiver of excitement down my spine.</li>
			<li>My breasts were freed while I was unconscious. There's a strange, liberating power in that thought.</li>
			<li>I wonder if my breasts looked nice while I was out. The thought of them being admired is a pleasant one.</li>
			<li>To be exposed like that, just my top half, feels like a tease. I can't help but feel a little flirty about it.</li>
			<li>The idea that someone saw my bare chest, the curve of my breasts... it's a secret thrill.</li>
			<li>I was an unconscious, topless spectacle. The image in my head is surprisingly arousing.</li>
			<li>My nipples are hard just thinking about it. Who saw them? Did they like what they saw?</li>
			<li>Waking up with my breasts out is a strange kind of rush. It's like a secret was shared without my knowledge.</li>
			<li>I feel a little spark of exhibitionism. I hope they appreciated the view I unknowingly provided.</li>
			<li>The thought of a lingering gaze on my bare chest is a potent one. I feel a flush of warmth spread through me.</li>
			<li>I was a damsel in distress, with my assets on display. It's a classic trope for a reason.</li>
			<li>My shirt is gone, but a sense of excitement remains. I was seen, and it felt... good.</li>
			<li>I wonder if they were gentle when they uncovered me. The thought of careful hands revealing my breasts is intoxicating.</li>
			<li>This is a memory I'll treasure in a strange way. The moment I woke up and realized my breasts had been on display.</li>
			<li>The vulnerability of being topless and unconscious is a huge turn-on.</li>
			<li>I feel a phantom touch on my skin, the ghost of a gaze on my nipples. It's a delicious feeling.</li>
			<li>I was a sleeping beauty, with a little extra something for the prince to see. The thought makes me giggle.</li>

			<li>I was out cold, and somewhere along the way, my shirt disappeared. My chest is bare. Okay. First things first, find out what happened.</li>
			<li>My head is spinning. My breasts are out. One problem at a time. The shirt can wait.</li>
			<li>They probably removed my shirt to check for injuries. It's a logical procedure.</li>
			<li>My torso is uncovered. It's a state of being, not a crisis.</li>
			<li>Breasts are just fatty tissue. People have seen them before. It's not a big deal.</li>
			<li>I'm aware my chest was exposed. It doesn't register as important right now.</li>
			<li>The fact that I'm topless is a minor detail in the grand scheme of things.</li>
			<li>I need to find a shirt. It's a practical consideration for warmth and social convention.</li>
			<li>I was unconscious, so I have no memory of being seen. It's difficult to be emotional about a non-memory.</li>
			<li>My upper body is nude. Acknowledged. Now, what's the actual problem here?</li>
			<li>I feel a draft on my chest. I should probably cover up.</li>
			<li>The situation is what it is. Being topless is part of it. I accept this fact and move on.</li>
			<li>I'm more concerned about the potential concussion than the fact someone saw my boobs.</li>
			<li>It's just a body. Everyone has one. The level of coverage is arbitrary.</li>
			<li>I'll add 'find shirt' to my mental checklist. It's right after 'check for broken bones'.</li>
			<li>I feel no particular emotion about this. It's just another strange thing that happened.</li>
			<li>I suppose it's better to be topless and alive than fully clothed and dead.</li>
			<li>The coolness on my skin is a physical sensation, not an emotional one.</li>
			<li>I've seen other women topless for various reasons. It's not a shocking event.</li>
			<li>So my shirt's gone. It was probably ugly anyway.</li>

			<li>My hands flew to my chest, a gasp escaping my lips. I was exposed. My shirt was gone. The feeling of being watched while I was helpless makes my skin crawl.</li>
			<li>Who did this? Who took my shirt? The thought of some creep staring at my breasts while I was unconscious makes me sick.</li>
			<li>I feel violated. My chest was bared for anyone to see without my permission. It's a disgusting breach of trust.</li>
			<li>A wave of shame and anger washes over me. To have my breasts exposed like that... it's humiliating.</li>
			<li>I feel like a piece of meat that was partially unwrapped for inspection. The thought is degrading.</li>
			<li>My privacy was invaded. They had no right to look at me like that, no matter the reason.</li>
			<li>The memory of being unconscious is now spoiled by this image of my bare breasts being on display.</li>
			<li>I'm shaking. The thought of their eyes on my nipples makes me feel dirty and used.</li>
			<li>This wasn't about helping me. This was an opportunity for them to gawk. I feel so angry.</li>
			<li>I feel so vulnerable and powerless. My body was treated like public property.</li>
			<li>I can't stop thinking about it. Who saw? What did they think? The uncertainty is a form of torture.</li>
			<li>This is a profound disrespect. I was a person in need of help, not a spectacle.</li>
			<li>I want to cover myself, but it's too late. The damage is done. They've already seen.</li>
			<li>The shame is a cold knot in my stomach. They saw an intimate part of me while I was completely vulnerable.</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to find who did this and make them understand the humiliation they've caused.</li>
			<li>My sense of safety is gone. If they can do this, what else are they capable of?</li>
			<li>I feel tainted by their gaze. I wish I could wash the feeling away.</li>
			<li>This is a violation I won't forget. The image of my exposed chest is burned into my mind.</li>
			<li>I feel reduced and objectified. My breasts are not for public consumption.</li>
			<li>The anger is so sharp it hurts. They took advantage of my weakness to satisfy their curiosity.</li>
