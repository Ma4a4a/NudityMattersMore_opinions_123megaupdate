<!-- Version History:

Nudity Matters More opinions 1.0.7
Rimworld 1.5

Fixes:
Removed filters for gender in self unisex descriptions. (should allow self private parts descriptions for non binary genders)
As i researched, it seems that gender "none" is not correct tag, and that could possibly blocked opinions to show up for non binary genders.


Nudity Matters More opinions 1.0.6
Rimworld 1.5

Improvement:
Now asleep and unconscious conditions finally works (bubbles will show only observer perspective, nudity log will show all perspectives).
Added more sleeping descriptions and new unconscious descriptions.

Fixes:
Caravan map open social log got error spawn.
Possible fix of Error processing situational opinion, Value cannot be null.

Nudity Matters More opinions 1.0.3
Rimworld 1.5

Fixes:
Fixed bug - mod was saving last observed name in filter while loading another save. (Creatrick reported that issue)

Total refactoring, centralized opinion filter for private parts and situations. (easier for fine tune or add new weights)

Improvement:

traits, ideology percepts, age, etc. (still need balancing, for more real feel)
