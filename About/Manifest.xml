<!-- Version History:

Nudity Matters More opinions 1.0.3
Rimworld 1.5

Fixes:
Fixed bug - mod was saving last observed name in filter while loading another save. (Creatrick reported that issue)
Reworked Nudity tab situational opinion log. Now it is more responsive, easier to navigate and scroll.
Total refactoring, centralized opinion filter for private parts and situations. (easier for fine tune or add new weights)

Improvement:
Reworked opinion selection (positive, neutral, negative).
Now there is complex calculations for opinoin mood, like gender, atractivness, social relations,
traits, ideology percepts, age, etc. (still need balancing, for more real feel)
