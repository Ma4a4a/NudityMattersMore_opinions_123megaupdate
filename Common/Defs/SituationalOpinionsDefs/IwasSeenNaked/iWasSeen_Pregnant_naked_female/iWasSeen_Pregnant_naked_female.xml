			<li>{OBSERVER_nameShort} saw me walking naked, {OBSERVER_pronoun} glimpsed at my belly, i feel warmth in my crotch.</li>
			<li>As I padded barefoot across the floor, my swollen breasts and rounded belly drawing attention to my first trimester glow, I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze lingering on me - or rather, on my very visible, very pregnant body. I flashed {OBSERVER_objective} a sultry smile, my eyes locked on {OBSERVER_possessive} as I sashayed past, deliberately swaying my hips to accentuate my curves.</li>
			<li>I was caught off guard, my hands instinctively flying to cover my breasts and belly as {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes roved over me, drinking in the sight of my naked, pregnant form. But as our gazes met, I felt a thrill of mischief and instead of hiding, I arched my back, letting my breasts swell forward, and gave {OBSERVER_objective} a sly, flirtatious glance.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes snapped to mine as {OBSERVER_pronoun} caught sight of me, my vagina slightly puffy and my belly softly rounded, and for a moment, we just stared at each other, the air thick with tension. Then, with a deliberate slowness, I reached out and trailed a hand over my breasts, my nipples tingling in response to the gentle touch.</li>
			<li>I was oblivious to everything except the feeling of my nipples brushing against the air, my breasts aching with sensitivity, when {OBSERVER_possessive} voice broke the spell, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze fixed on me like a hot brand. As I turned to face {OBSERVER_objective}, my belly led the way, my rounded abdomen proclaiming my pregnancy to the world, and I felt a rush of excitement at the way {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes lingered on my curves.</li>
			<li>I felt {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes on me like a physical touch, my skin prickling with awareness as {OBSERVER_nameShort} took in the sight of my nudity, my breasts and belly on full display. With a slow, sinuous movement, I raised my arms, letting my breasts lift and swell, and gave {OBSERVER_objective} a provocative smile, daring {OBSERVER_objective} to look {OBSERVER_possessive} fill.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} glance was like a jolt of electricity, sparking a response in me that I couldn't ignore - I felt my nipples harden, my vagina tingle, and my breasts grow heavier, as if responding to {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze alone. With a sense of reckless abandon, I took a step closer, my belly leading the way, and let my eyes lock onto his</li>
			<li>As I sashayed across the room, I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze lingering on my swollen belly, my nipples standing at attention beneath my skin, and my lips fluttering with a sly smile as I relished the attention. I deliberately slowed my pace, letting {OBSERVER_objective} drink in the sight of my naked, pregnant form, my vagina aching with a mix of embarrassment and arousal.</li>
			<li>I was startled to find {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes fixed on me, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze tracing the gentle curve of my pregnant belly, the engorged breasts that seemed to defy gravity, and the soft, pink folds of my vulva. I felt a flush rise to my cheeks as I met {OBSERVER_possessive} stare, my body responding to {OBSERVER_possessive} scrutiny by growing warmer, wetter.</li>
			<li>I was caught off guard by {OBSERVER_possessive} sudden attention, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes locking onto my naked body like a magnet, drawn to the subtle swell of my belly, the darkening nipples, and the newly defined curves of my hips. I couldn't help but sway towards {OBSERVER_objective}, my breasts jiggling ever so slightly as I moved, my heart pounding in anticipation.</li>
			<li>As {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes roamed over my body, I felt a shiver run down my spine, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze igniting a fire that seemed to burn brightest at the junction of my thighs, where my vulva pulsed with a newfound sensitivity. I reached out, my hand drifting across my belly, my fingers tracing the contours of my swollen breasts as I arched towards {OBSERVER_objective}, inviting {OBSERVER_objective} to join me.</li>
			<li>I was seen, and I reveled in the feeling, my body glowing under {OBSERVER_possessive} admiring gaze, which seemed to caress every inch of my skin, from the rounded swell of my belly to the dusky areolae of my breasts. I let my eyes drop, my gaze drifting down to the place where my thighs met, and I couldn't help but feel a thrill at the sight of my own arousal.</li>
			<li>I couldn't help but notice the way {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes stuck to me, {OBSERVER_possessive} pupils dilating as {OBSERVER_pronoun} drank in the sight of my naked, pregnant body, the rounded belly, the full breasts, and the delicate petals of my vulva. I smiled to myself, a sly, sensual smile, as I struck a pose, my body angled to showcase its new curves.</li>

			<li>I didn’t think much when {OBSERVER_nameShort} saw me naked with growing belly, it’s natural.</li>
			<li>I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze as {OBSERVER_pronoun} walked into the room, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes lingering on my naked form, my belly just starting to show a subtle curve in the first trimester of pregnancy. I didn't bother to cover myself, simply raising an eyebrow at {OBSERVER_possessive} scrutiny.</li>
			<li>I was aware of {OBSERVER_possessive} presence behind me, {OBSERVER_possessive} footsteps pausing as {OBSERVER_pronoun} took in my naked body, my breasts slightly swollen and my vagina still tight despite the early stages of pregnancy. I didn't turn around, too caught up in my own thoughts to care about {OBSERVER_possessive} reaction.</li>
			<li>As I walked past {OBSERVER_nameShort}, I noticed {OBSERVER_possessive} glance drifting down my body, lingering on the soft swell of my belly and the gentle rounding of my hips in the first trimester of pregnancy. I felt a detached sense of curiosity about {OBSERVER_possessive} reaction, but didn't bother to engage with it.</li>
			<li>I was examined by {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze as I stood naked, my body a map of subtle changes in the early stages of pregnancy - the slight thickening of my waist, the darkening of my nipples. I didn't flinch or cover myself, simply met {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze with a neutral expression.</li>
			<li>I felt {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes on me as I moved through the room, my naked body on display, my breasts and belly still firm but with a hint of softness that came with pregnancy. I didn't react, too comfortable in my own skin to care about {OBSERVER_possessive} opinion.</li>
			<li>I saw {OBSERVER_possessive} reflection in the window as {OBSERVER_pronoun} watched me, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes fixed on my naked form - the gentle curve of my belly, the subtle swelling of my breasts and labia in the first trimester of pregnancy. I didn't acknowledge {OBSERVER_objective}, too absorbed in my own thoughts to bother with {OBSERVER_possessive} reaction.</li>
			<li>I was spotted walking naked by {OBSERVER_nameShort}, my expanding belly and slightly darker nipples the only noticeable changes in my body, a testament to the tiny life growing inside me. I met {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze with a nonchalant smile, unfazed by {OBSERVER_possessive} surprise.</li>
			<li>As I strolled naked through the room, I noticed {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes widen, fixed on the gentle swell of my abdomen and the subtle fullness of my breasts, but I simply ran a hand through my hair, unbothered by {OBSERVER_possessive} attention. {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes lingered on my pubic area, but I didn't react.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_nameShort} caught me walking naked, and {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze was drawn to the slight bulge of my belly, but I just shrugged, unselfconscious about my body's changes, and continued on my way, my breasts swaying slightly with each step. I saw the flicker of surprise in {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes, but I didn't acknowledge it.</li>
			<li>As I walked into the room, I was aware of {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on me, taking in the sight of my naked body, my breasts slightly heavier and my nipples more sensitive, and the faint curve of my abdomen, but I didn't flinch. I simply raised an eyebrow, expecting {OBSERVER_objective} to say something, but {OBSERVER_pronoun} remained silent.</li>
			<li>I was examined by {OBSERVER_possessive} startled expression as I walked naked, my body a map of subtle changes - the soft rounding of my belly, the fullness of my breasts, the slight darkening of my nipples - but I didn't feel any self-consciousness, just a detached curiosity about {OBSERVER_possessive} reaction. I met {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes, my expression neutral, and waited for {OBSERVER_objective} to look away.</li>
			<li>I noticed a glance from {OBSERVER_nameShort} as I walked naked, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes drifting over the new topography of my body, the swell of my abdomen, the tender flesh of my breasts, but I just blinked slowly, unbothered by {OBSERVER_possessive} interest. I didn't make any effort to cover myself, simply continuing on my way, my vagina and breasts exposed to {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze, but my expression serene.</li>

			<li>Ugh, {OBSERVER_nameShort} saw me naked, instinctively i covered belly and forgot about pussy and breasts.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_nameShort} saw me bare, i hate showing my private parts like in a stadium.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_nameShort} saw me naked, i’m sure {OBSERVER_pronoun} thinging of {OBSERVER_possessive} impregnated me.</li>
			<li>I found myself exposed to {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze, barefoot and pregnant, my belly swelling and breasts heavy, as I hurriedly covered myself, seething with annoyance.</li>
			<li>Caught off guard, I felt a wave of frustration as {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes took in my changing body, my burgeoning belly and the subtle changes to my vagina, all while I grabbed the nearest clothing to shield myself.</li>
			<li>In the early stages of pregnancy, I was confronted with an unexpected encounter with {OBSERVER_nameShort}, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze lingering on my fuller breasts and rounded belly, leaving me feeling violated and irritated.</li>
			<li>As I walked unclothed, I was met with {OBSERVER_possessive} startled glance, my belly and vagina's shifts in appearance being a source of self-consciousness and annoyance for me.</li>
			<li>My early pregnancy was a time of many changes, one of which was the shift in my body, a shift that was unfortunately seen by {OBSERVER_nameShort}, making me feel vulnerable and cross.</li>
			<li>I was filled with displeasure as I noticed {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on my shifting form, the belly that was just starting to show and the breasts that were growing denser, making me feel exposed and grumpy.</li>
			<li>As I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze, I felt a surge of annoyance at being seen walking naked while my belly, still tender and barely swollen with the first trimester of pregnancy, seemed to be on full display. I quickly crossed my arms over my breasts, which had grown more sensitive and fuller than usual, and narrowed my eyes at {OBSERVER_objective}.</li>
			<li>I was examined by {OBSERVER_possessive} unwanted glance, my naked body - the gentle curve of my pregnant belly, the slight darkening of my nipples, and the faint puffiness of my vulva - seemingly under a microscope. I instinctively covered my breasts and wrapped my arms around myself, trying to shield my vulnerable body from {OBSERVER_possessive} intrusive gaze.</li>
			<li>I noticed {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes drifting toward me as I walked by, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze lingering on my naked form, which, in the early stages of pregnancy, felt both more vulnerable and more exposed - the slight roundedness of my belly, the subtle firming of my nipples, the increased fullness of my breasts. I shot {OBSERVER_objective} a withering look, daring {OBSERVER_objective} to keep staring.</li>
			<li>As {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes landed on me, I felt a shiver run down my spine, my naked body - the tender flesh of my belly, the engorged breasts, the intimate folds of my vulva - reacting to the unwanted attention. I hastily grabbed a nearby towel, wrapping it around myself like a protective shield.</li>
			<li>I was caught off guard by {OBSERVER_possessive} sudden look, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes taking in my naked body - the soft, pale skin of my pregnant belly, the erect nipples, the rounded outline of my breasts - with an unnerving intensity. I swiftly turned away, my heart racing with discomfort and embarrassment.</li>
			<li>I felt a flash of irritation as {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze fell on me, my naked self - the almost imperceptible swell of my belly, the heightened sensitivity of my nipples, the fullness of my breasts - awkwardly exposed to {OBSERVER_possessive} viewing pleasure. I deliberately kept my back to {OBSERVER_objective}, making it clear I wouldn't engage with {OBSERVER_possessive} prying eyes.</li>

			<li>I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze as I walked naked, my swollen belly and breasts on full display, and I couldn't help but notice the way {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes lingered on the darkening nipples and the soft, round curve of my vagina, now slightly more prominent with my pregnancy. I felt a shiver run down my spine as I met {OBSERVER_possessive} stare, my hand instinctively drifting to my belly, tracing the contours of my growing abdomen.</li>
			<li>As I strolled through the room, I sensed {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes on me, and I deliberately slowed my pace, savoring the feeling of {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on my exposed skin - the smooth, taut expanse of my belly, the tender flesh of my breasts, and the delicate folds of my vagina, all on full display during my second trimester. I flashed {OBSERVER_objective} a sly smile, aware that my pregnancy had only amplified my desire, and I reveled in the attention.</li>
			<li>I felt {OBSERVER_possessive} hot gaze on me, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes fixed on my naked form, drinking in the sight of my swelling belly, engorged breasts, and the soft, ripe flesh of my vagina, so visible now that I was a few months pregnant. I ran my hand over my curves, feeling a thrill of excitement as I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} stare, my body responding to {OBSERVER_possessive} interest by growing more aroused.</li>
			<li>I caught myself in the act of being admired, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze locked onto my pregnant body, and I reveled in the sensation of being so openly desired. My breasts felt heavy and sensitive, my nipples aching for attention, and my vagina pulsed with a newfound awareness, my body surrendering to the thrill of being seen and wanted.</li>
			<li>As I padded across the floor, I felt the weight of {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on me, and I consciously paraded my pregnancy for {OBSERVER_objective} - my rounded belly, my lush breasts, and my swollen vagina, all on display in a shameless exhibition of my changing body. I watched as {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes followed my every move, my heart pounding with excitement as I deliberately teased {OBSERVER_objective}, reveling in the reaction I was getting.</li>

			<li>I don't really care about walking around naked with a growing belly, {OBSERVER_nameShort} looked at my body, but it doesn't bother {OBSERVER_possessive} me.</li>
			<li>As I padded barefoot across the floor, I was seen by {OBSERVER_nameShort}, my naked body on full display in all its second-trimester glory - my swollen belly, full breasts, and slightly darker vaginal area all exposed to {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze. I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} glance and merely raised an eyebrow, unbothered by {OBSERVER_possessive} stare.</li>
			<li>I was examined by {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes as I walked by, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze roving over my naked skin, taking in the rounded curve of my pregnant belly, the prominent nipples on my breasts, and the soft folds of my vulva. I felt a flicker of indifference, too apathetic to even cover up.</li>
			<li>I noticed a glance from {OBSERVER_nameShort} as I strolled naked into the room, my second-trimester body a testament to my growing pregnancy - my belly a gentle slope, my breasts heavier, my nipples darker. I didn't bother to respond, simply continuing on my way as if {OBSERVER_pronoun} wasn't even there.</li>
			<li>I was caught by {OBSERVER_nameShort} in all my naked, pregnant glory, my body a map of changes - the swell of my belly, the puffiness of my breasts, the subtle shift in my vaginal shape. I shrugged inwardly, unconcerned by {OBSERVER_possessive} interest, and kept moving.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes landed on me as I walked by, naked and unselfconscious in my second trimester - my belly a pronounced curve, my breasts full and heavy, my vulva slightly more prominent. I felt a twinge of amusement at {OBSERVER_possessive} surprise, but didn't break stride.</li>
			<li>I was seen, and I knew it - {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on my naked body, taking in the transformation of my pregnancy - the rounded belly, the enlarged breasts, the subtle changes in my genital area. I didn't react, simply kept going about my business as if I was alone.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes landed on me, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze lingering on my swollen belly and breasts, now heavier and fuller in their second-trimester glory, as I walked naked across the room. My vagina, slightly darker and more prominent than before, seemed to hold {OBSERVER_possessive} attention for a beat longer than necessary.</li>
			<li>As I strolled naked through the space, I noticed {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes flicker towards me, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze snagging on the curve of my pregnant belly and the slight swell of my breasts, before moving on to my face with a neutral expression. I didn't react, too accustomed to my own body's changes to be fazed.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes met mine as I walked by, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze briefly dipping to take in my pregnant form, the roundness of my belly and the subtle changes in my breasts and vagina, before returning to my face with a hint of curiosity. I raised an eyebrow, but said nothing.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes roved over me, lingering on the soft swell of my belly, the darker line of my pubic area, and the fuller curves of my breasts, before coming back to my face, {OBSERVER_possessive} expression unreadable. I didn't feel like covering up, or explaining myself.</li>
			<li>As I moved through the space, {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze drifted towards me, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes tracing the contours of my pregnant body, noting the way my breasts and belly seemed to have grown overnight, the subtle changes in my vagina and hips. I felt no embarrassment, only a mild awareness of {OBSERVER_possessive} attention.</li>

			<li>I felt {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes on me, and I knew I was a spectacle - a naked, pregnant woman, my body distorted by the swell of new life, my breasts heavy and achy, my vagina...well, it was just there, wasn't it? I shot {OBSERVER_objective} a look of disdain, daring {OBSERVER_objective} to say something, to comment on my appearance.</li>
			<li>As I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} eye, I was aware of the flush rising to my cheeks, my hand instinctively moving to cover my belly, my breasts, my...everything. But it was too late; he'd already seen me, and I could tell by the flicker in {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze that {OBSERVER_pronoun} was taken aback by the sight of me, pregnant and naked.</li>
			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} gaze was like a physical touch, and I felt my skin crawl as {OBSERVER_pronoun} looked at me, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes lingering on the curves of my body, the swell of my belly, the fullness of my breasts. I wrapped my arms around myself, trying to cover the most exposed parts of me, but I knew it was too late; he'd already seen everything.</li>
			<li>I felt {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze on me like a jolt, my heart sinking as I realized I was completely exposed - my pregnant belly, my heavy breasts, my...everything. I tried to stand up straight, to defy {OBSERVER_objective} with my presence, but my voice was shaking as I spoke, my annoyance and embarrassment warring for dominance.</li>

			<li>I was aware of {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes on me as I padded across the room, my naked body glowing with a soft, pregnant light, my breasts heavy and pendulous, my vulva plump and prominent, and I felt a shiver run down my spine as I met {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze, my own eyes sparkling with a knowing glint.

			<li>I was examined by {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze, {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes roving over my naked form, taking in the ripe, swollen curves of my belly, the delicate folds of my vagina, and the lush fullness of my breasts, and I felt a flutter in my chest as {OBSERVER_pronoun} looked at me, {OBSERVER_possessive} face set in a mask of studied calm.

I snuck a peek at {OBSERVER_objective}, and found {OBSERVER_possessive} eyes still on me, {OBSERVER_possessive} face burning with a subtle flush.</li>
			<li>I noticed a flush rise to {OBSERVER_possessive} cheeks as {OBSERVER_pronoun} caught sight of me strolling by, my naked body on full display - my breasts bounced with each step, my vagina drew a slight pout, and my belly led the way, a veritable parade of flesh.

			<li>{OBSERVER_nameShort} looked at my naked body with a big belly, but all I care about is my swollen breasts.</li>
			<li>I caught {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze as I strolled past {OBSERVER_objective}, my swollen belly and full breasts on display, unbothered by my nakedness in the third trimester of my pregnancy.</li>

			<li>{OBSERVER_possessive} eyes widened as {OBSERVER_pronoun} took in my naked form, my belly protruding, breasts engorged, and vagina swollen, but I just smiled to myself and kept walking. I was too busy thinking about my plans for the day to let {OBSERVER_possessive} stare faze me.</li>
			<li>As I padded across the floor, my naked body swaying with each step, I saw {OBSERVER_possessive} gaze flicker to my breasts, then my belly, and finally my vulva, but I didn't feel the need to react. I simply continued on my way, my movements unhurried and unselfconscious.</li>
