			<li>I woke up without pants on. It happens.</li>
			<li>My lower half was bare. It was a bit chilly, so I found the blanket.</li>
			<li>Seems I kicked off my pants again. I should probably find them.</li>
			<li>Woke up bottomless. I was comfortable, so whatever.</li>
			<li>I noticed I was exposed from the waist down. I just got up and started my day.</li>
			<li>I'm a restless sleeper, so this is pretty standard.</li>
			<li>There was a draft. Realized it's because I had no pants on. I didn't give it much thought.</li>
			<li>I woke up, noticed I was bottomless, and then my mind immediately went to what's for breakfast.</li>
			<li>It must have gotten warm last night. Waking up without pants seems like a reasonable unconscious decision.</li>
			<li>My legs were tangled in the sheets, and my pants were somewhere in the mess. It was a minor morning puzzle.</li>
			<li>I felt the air on my skin and realized I was bare from the waist down. It was a simple observation.</li>
			<li>I woke up. I was bottomless. The sun was up. Time to get to work.</li>
			<li>My body must have decided it didn't want pants on last night. I didn't really notice until I woke up.</li>
			<li>I took a moment to find my pants before getting out of bed. It was just a thing to do.</li>
			<li>Waking up exposed like this is just something that happens. No point in making a big deal out of it.</li>
			<li>I registered my state of undress, but my thoughts were already on my duties.</li>
			<li>I was bottomless. I blinked, processed it, and then rolled over for a few more minutes of rest.</li>
			<li>The state of my clothing, or lack thereof, was not particularly noteworthy.</li>
			<li>I woke up feeling neither embarrassed nor proud about being bottomless, just... awake.</li>
			<li>I found my pants on the floor. I must have been really out of it.</li>

			<li>I woke with a start, realizing I was completely bare from the waist down. A hot flush of embarrassment made my skin crawl.</li>
			<li>My heart pounded when I realized I was exposed. The thought of someone seeing my genitals on display is mortifying.</li>
			<li>I felt a wave of pure panic. I was asleep, bottomless, and totally vulnerable. I've never felt so foolish.</li>
			<li>I scrambled to cover myself, my hands fumbling with the blanket. The humiliation is intense. How could I be so careless?</li>
			<li>The air felt cold and mocking on my bare skin. I feel disgusting and exposed, as if my dignity has been stripped away.</li>
			<li>I feel a deep, burning shame. To be seen like that... it's a degrading nightmare.</li>
			<li>My mind is racing. Who saw me? Were they laughing? I feel sick with anxiety.</li>
			<li>I feel so stupid and exposed. I wish I could just disappear.</li>
			<li>A cold dread washed over me as I realized my situation. I feel like less of a man, somehow, for being seen in such a helpless state.</li>
			<li>I woke up feeling like something was terribly wrong, and then I saw why. My own body, a source of public spectacle. I wanted to punch something.</li>
			<li>The room feels hostile now. My own bed feels like a place of shame.</li>
			<li>I can't stop thinking about it. Me, asleep, completely exposed. It's an invasive, infuriating thought.</li>
			<li>I'm filled with a helpless anger, mostly at myself. How could I let my guard down so completely?</li>
			<li>I feel a desperate need to regain my composure, but the feeling of being seen and judged is hard to shake.</li>
			<li>The vulnerability is emasculating. I feel like a joke, and it makes my blood boil.</li>
			<li>I'm terrified of who might have seen me. The thought of their eyes on me is unbearable.</li>
			<li>I pulled the blanket around myself tightly, but it couldn't block out the memory of being so utterly exposed.</li>
			<li>I feel a profound sense of compromised privacy. It was stolen from me while I was unconscious.</li>
			<li>Every sound seems like a snicker. I'm paranoid and ashamed.</li>
			<li>I wish I could just forget this ever happened. But the memory is a fresh wound, stinging with humiliation and anger.</li>
